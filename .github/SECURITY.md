# üîí Security Guidelines for nxtbn

Welcome to the security guidelines for **Next Billion Native Commerce (nxtbn)**. This document outlines best practices for ensuring the security of your nxtbn deployment, as well as procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices
To maintain a secure environment, please follow these best practices:

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your nxtbn installation, dependencies, and server operating systems up to date. This ensures you have the latest security patches and features.
